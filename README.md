# Web Frameworks
An introspection into different node web frameworks

## Overview
I will start out by making an Express server with at least one CRUD endpoint to serve as a criteria on which to base a 
comparison. Then I will test different other node web frameworks. Firstly I will compare Express to the
younger sister KOA which has also been developed by the team behind Express.

When comparing different web frameworks I need some criteria to base my evaluation. My evaluation 
criteria will be based on the ease of development. 

* how easy is it to find documentation
* is the documentation easy to understand
* Lines of code to implement CRUD
* The easiness of extending the api with features such as authentication
